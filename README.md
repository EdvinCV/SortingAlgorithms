# SortingAlgorithms
Sorting Algorithms Visualization with HTML, CSS and Javascript

This project was made to implement and visualize the most common sorting algorithms, in this project I used only Javascript without a library or framework just to practice the basis of Javascript lenguage.
If you want to try this project don't need to install anything, just to be sure to have internet to use SweetAlert.
